  			<h2>Data Collection Method</h2>
<p>
This mapping project relies on data from a 7 year case study of Obama Hope that I have collected using the method of iconographic tracking. As I (2013; 2015) discussed in detail elsewhere, iconographic tracking is a digital research method that accounts for the rhetorical transformation that images undergo as they circulate and become embroiled in various collective activities. Iconographic tracking has proved very effective in generating large data and metadata sets related to Obama Hope. This efficacy, of course, is due in part to the image itself. In Yrjö Engeström’s (2007) terms, Obama Hope is a run away object that began as a seemingly insignificant innovation, but acquired global influence as it began to circulate uncontrollably, escalate in practice beyond its originally intended use, and spark far-reaching, and often unpredictable, consequences. Obama Hope in its “Faireyized” version first entered into circulation in late January 2008 in an effort to help then-Senator Obama become the 44th U.S. President. Since then, digital manifestations and remixes of this image have surfaced on more than 2,000,000 websites, thanks, in part, to the invention of multiple software programs and apps that make it possible to generate digital remixes of Obama Hope with the click of a few buttons. As it has circulated both within and beyond U.S. borders, Obama Hope has also left visual traces of on-the–ground activity as it has become embroiled in hundreds of different collective actions and transformed across genre, medium, and function. Such divergent activities entail acting as, among other things, a political actor in elections across the world, an advertising agent in places such as Turkey and China, and an international activist in the Arab Spring and Occupy movements. Today, such materialization is still ongoing; Obama Hope most recently, for instance, has been remixed to critique the NSA and show support for Edward Snowden, to generate support for the #Not1More Deportation’s transnational campaign, and to garner support for candidates in the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election. Such divergent rhetorical activities have left hordes of visual evidence that iconographic tracking has been able to recover.
</p><p>

For my original case study, I deployed iconographic tracking to discover how the Obama Hope image was able to go viral and become iconic in such a short time span as well as discover what kinds of contributions it has made to collective life since the 2008 election season. To find answers to such questions, I relied on various visual search engines such as Google Images and TinEye; social media sites such as Flickr, Twitter, and Facebook; editorial photographic services such as AP Images, Getty Images, and Reuters; and thousands of other sites such as commercial and personal websites, online news organizations, and online forums--research that entailed looking at thousands of pictures (10,000 for certain, if not 20,000) for sightings of Obama Hope. I also conducted field research in Boston, MA to see the Obama Hope image in both a gallery setting and on urban streets, visited an African Studies archive at Northeastern University, conducted several phone and email interviews with citizens and designers here in the U.S. and abroad, and distributed over 50 questionnaires to various artists and political cartoonists around the country.
</p><p>

This research has thus far culminated in 40,000+word account of the rich and complex rhetorical life of Obama Hope that, I believe, is fairly reliable in terms of empirical research (see Part III in Still Life with Rhetoric). Yet, visualizations are useful because they leverage distant reading methods that allow us “to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text [or picture]: devices, themes, tropes—or genres and systems” (Morretti, 2000, n.p). Important for this webtext project, distant reading especially is useful for examining one text or picture “as one among many and conside[r] a much larger corpus whose contexts and relationships give rise to different forms of meaning” (Eyman, 2015, p. 95). Visualizations also require translating cultural artifacts into data (by capturing content, form, and use) (Manovich, 2013, p. 257) and generating metadata (data about data), a process that helps us notice trends (and anomalies) and develop questions that other research strategies might not provoke. In addition to helping us discover novel patterns and previously unidentified relationships, generating visualizations often necessitates conducting deeper research to extend data sets--research actions that open up new research directions, strengthen meta data sets, and hence lead to new insights. My goal with the Obama Hope case study is to eventually create both a book length rhetorical biography of this single, multiple image and a documentary about the Obama Art Movement. I thus embarked on this digital visualization project at this particular juncture to see if there are any manifestations and rhetorical activities of Obama Hope I might have missed during my initial research. I particularly wanted to know what I could learn about Obama Hope’s circulation, transformation, and collective activities by generating visualizations of its travels, emergence in different genres and media, participation in various collective activities, and divergent rhetorical functions. How might digital visualization techniques, in other words, help me think and write differently about Obama Hope?
</p><p>

To find answers to these questions, I expanded my original data set by using iconographic tracking to collect more documentation of Obama Hope’s circulation, manifestations, and collective activities. Because I had already collected much data for my original case study, for this project I used a nonprobability sampling method, meaning I selected data in a nonrandom fashion. To be more specific, I began by conducting nonproportional quota sampling to identify the various genres in which Obama Hope had become engaged. While I estimated their proportions in the overall data population and hence knew that I needed to make sure certain genres had more representation in sampling than others, I chose to not match sample numbers with population proportions. I made this choice because I wanted to make sure the unique Obama Hope creations belonging to smaller genres groups (such as food art) were adequately represented and not overshadowed by the hundreds and hundreds of Obamicons and sightings of Obama Hope stickers and posters that have been produced and documented. Once I identified the specific genres to be represented in sampling, I then conducted judgment sampling to find pictures that are representative of those genres. Today, this data set consists of 1000 digital image files (jpegs, pngs, and gifs) that depict Obamicons and photographs of Obama Hope either reproduced or remixed in various media and genres.
