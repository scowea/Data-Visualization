  			<h2>Data Collection Method</h2>
<p>
This mapping project relies on data from a 6 year case study of Obama Hope’s ongoing rhetorical transformation, which I have collected using the method of iconographic tracking. As I (2013) discuss in detail elsewhere, iconographic tracking is a digital research method that accounts for the rhetorical transformation that images undergo as they circulate and become embroiled in various collective activities. Rhetorical transformation, as conceived here, is a temporally distended process of becoming in which rhetoric is actualized in space in unpredictable, divergent, and inconsistent ways. Thus, rather than solely focus on the rhetorical situation in which an artifact is initially produced and rely on a representational approach to analyze the compositional elements and strategies found within the still life of that artifact, iconographic tracking follows an image as it circulates, documents its multiple transformations, and traces its divergent rhetorical activities. This method, in other words, accounts for the futurity of visual rhetoric—the strands of time beyond the initial moment of rhetorical production when consequences unfold as artifacts circulate, enter into diverse kinds of relations, and transform across form, genre, and networks.
</p><p>
Iconographic tracking has proved very effective in generating large data and metadata sets related to Obama Hope. This efficacy, of course, is due in part to the image itself. In Yrjö Engeström’s terms, Obama Hope is a run away object that began as a seemingly insignificant innovation, but acquired global influence as it began to circulate uncontrollably, escalate in practice beyond its originally intended use, and spark far-reaching, and often unpredictable consequences. Obama Hope in its “Faireyized” version first entered into circulation in late January 2008 in an effort to help then-Senator Obama become the 44th U.S. President. Since then, digital manifestations and remixes of this image have surfaced on more than 2,000,000 websites, thanks, in part, to the invention of multiple software programs and apps that make it possible to generate digital remixes of Obama Hope with the click of a few buttons. As it has circulated both within and beyond U.S. borders, Obama Hope has also left visual traces of on-the–ground activity as it has become embroiled in hundreds of different collective actions and transformed across genre, medium, and function. Such divergent activities entail acting, among other things, as a political actor in elections across the world, an advertising agent in places such as Turkey and China, and an international activist in the Arab Spring and Occupy movements. Today, such materialization is still ongoing; Obama Hope most recently, for instance, has been remixed to win votes for candidates in India’s last presidential election, to critique the NSA and show support for Edward Snowden, and to generate support for the #Not1More Deportation’s transnational campaign. Such divergent rhetorical activities have left hordes of visual evidence that iconographic tracking has been able to recover. 
</p><p>
For my original case study, I deployed iconographic tracking to discover how the Obama Hope image was able to go viral and become iconic in such a short time span as well as discover what kinds of contributions it has made to collective life since the 2008 election season. To find answers to such questions, I relied on various visual search engines such as Google Images and TinEye; social media sites such as Flickr and Facebook; editorial photographic services such as AP Images, Getty Images, and Reuters; and open software applications such as Zotero to investigate at least 20,000 images, multiple social networking sites, and thousands of other sites such as commercial and personal websites, online news organizations, and online forums. I also conducted field research in Boston, MA to see the Obama Hope image in both a gallery setting and on urban streets, visited an African Studies archive at Northeastern University, conducted several phone and email interviews with citizens and designers here in the U.S. and abroad, and distributed over 50 questionnaires to various artists and political cartoonists around the country. This research has thus far culminated in 40,000+ word account of the rich and complex rhetorical life of Obama Hope that, I believe, is fairly reliable in terms of empirical research and is being published in my current book<sup>1</sup>. 
</p><p>
Yet, visualizations are useful because they require translating cultural artifacts into data (by capturing content, form, and use) (Manovich’s Visualization Methods for Media Studies) and generating metadata (data about data), a process that helps us notice trends (and anomalies) and develop questions that our own research strategies might not provoke. Digital visualizations are also able to explore large data sets without preconceived ideas about research findings as well as find novel patterns and make visible previously unidentified relationships. In addition, generating visualizations often necessitates conducting deeper research to extend data sets--research actions that open up new research directions, strengthen meta data sets, and hence lead to new insights. My goal with the Obama Hope case study is to eventually create a book length rhetorical biography of this single, multiple image<sup>2</sup>. I thus embarked on this data visualization project at this particular juncture to see if there are any manifestations and collective activities of Obama Hope I might have missed during my research for my current book. I particularly wanted to know what I could learn about Obama Hope’s circulation, transformation, and collective activities by generating visualizations of its travels, emergence in different genres and media, participation in various collective activities, and divergent rhetorical functions. How might engaging in this visual play, in other words, help me think and write differently about Obama Hope?
</p><p>
To find answers to these questions, I expanded my original data set by using iconographic tracking to collect more documentation of Obama Hope’s circulation, manifestations, and collective activities. Today, this data set consists of 650 digital image files (jpegs, pngs, and gifs) that depict Obamicons (digitally born pictures generated in the style of Obama Hope) and photographs of Obama Hope either reproduced or remixed in various media and genres. To store my research data, I initially relied on Zotero, which helped me mine data and save urls that documented Obama Hope’s multiple transformations and collective activities. (See Gries 2013). For this data visualization project, I needed a software program that would allow me to (RELY ON SCOTT HERE). I thus entered my original and well as new research findings into a Google Fushion Table.

Google Fushion Tables is an open source, experimental app that enables researchers to easily upload, organize, query, and share data sets. The advantage of this app is that … (Scott needs to help here).
