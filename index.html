<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
As Jim Ridolfo and William Hardt-Davidson (2015) made evident in their edited collection Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities, over the last three years, research activity in the field of rhetoric and composition/writing studies has begun to take note of the digital humanities (p. 1). While such research has been quite diverse, many scholars are turning toward bigger data sets and exploiting digital data visualizations for their scholarly practices. Thus far, much of this work has been related to disciplinary studies. Within the last few years In Kairos, for instance, we have been privy to Jeremy Tirrell’s (2012) digital maps that offer a geographical history of online rhetoric and composition journals as well as Derek Mueller’s (2012) nephological models of the CCCC Chairs’ Addresses. According to both these scholars, taking such risks with large data sets to visually represent discrete information has many rewards. For Mueller, media visualizations such as tag clouds help develop a networked sense, an aptitude that helps find patterns and themes in scholarly production and thus eases the task of “keeping up” with the field’s scholarship over the long haul. Thanks to a wide range of suitable and freely accessible tools, Tirrell reminded us, such work with digital visualizations is not only possible but within our reach as motivated rhetoricians and compositionists. We ought thus be looking for ways to take more advantage of their affordances in our various studies.
</p><p>
In this webtext, I want to take up this challenge to explore what digital visualization techniques can do for visual rhetoric and circulation studies—the study of rhetoric and writing in motion. By digital visualization techniques, I draw on the work of Ralph Lenglar and Martin Eppler (2007) and Lev Manovich (2013) to mean strategies that use existing or new custom-designed software to collect, process, analyze, and visualize data in ways that are conducive for producing individual insight and collective knowledge. As a scholar who has spent the last seven years tracking the circulation of Shepard Fairey’s now iconic Obama Hope image (henceforth referred to as Obama Hope), I am intrigued by the idea of moving beyond  simply studying visual artifacts produced by others toward designing and deploying visual data to help collect, analyze, and visualize research findings. Especially as scholars work with circulation to investigate how rhetoric is a process of distributed emergence and ongoing circulation (Edbauer 2006), digital visualization techniques have potential to help map out this complex process. As scholars grow more and more attuned to the networked complexity of visual rhetoric, they will thus benefit from finding ways to deal with large data sets and exploring how digital visualizations can enhance their scholarly practices.
</p><p>
Cultural analytics—the use of computational and visualization methods for analyzing massive  sets and flows of cultural data and flows--already making headway into the visualization of large collections of pictorial data. The Software Studies Initiative under the lead of Lev Manovich, for instance, has produced a free software tool called ImagePlot that helps discover patterns in paintings, films, animations, video games, and other moving data. For visual rhetoric scholars interested in design, ImagePlot is particularly useful for identifying subtle differences among large sets of pictures that the human eye often cannot detect, particularly variations in terms of color, pitch, and grayscale. In light of such benefits, ImagePlot can help analyze the shifting style of an artist’s oeuvre or a particular art movement. More close to my own research, ImagePlot can also help identify pictorial differentiations of a highly remixed image such as Obama Hope, which manifests in unique ways across multiple genres, media, and forms.
</p><p>
Yet while ImagePlot can help discover important revelations about design, this software program is not well equipped to account for particular image’s circulation, genre uptake, and distributed collective activities, which is my main concern here. Therefore, in this webtext, I explore how other kinds of digital mapping such as Google Maps, Dynamic Heat Maps, Word Clouds, and Actor-Network Maps can be productive for both conducting and communicating research in visual rhetorics. These visualizations, as the following sections make clear, rely on metadata generated through manual coding of 1000 pictures in which Obama Hope has manifested in various media, forms, and genres around the world since 2008. Working in tight collaboration with Scott Weaver, a computer programmer from Portland, Oregon, I specifically designed these maps to help visualize where Obama Hope has traveled, in what genres it has surfaced, and in what collective activities it has become deeply embroiled.
</p><p>
The purpose of this mapping project is purely experimental in that while I have previously done some geographic and network mapping to track Obama Hope (see Gries 2015), I have little idea of whether expanding my computational analysis and visualization efforts will yield more productive results. As we begin to work with larger data sets and play with visualization as a research strategy, we cannot let the unknown prevent us from experimentation though. We must, as Joyce Carter  (2015) notes, move forward with the awareness that innovation is “a product of risk-taking with no guarantee of reward, and the very real possibility of failure.” Fortunately, in spite of such risks, my visual experimentation with large data sets does confirm that there is much to be gained by turning toward computational analysis and visualization methods in visual rhetoric. Not only can visualization methods be an innovative avenue for both doing and presenting research in visual rhetorics, it can also help us, as scholars and teachers, become more data literate.
