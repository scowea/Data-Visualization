  			<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
As the field of rhetoric and composition/writing studies forges deeper and deeper connections with the digital humanities, scholars are beginning to turn toward bigger data sets and to exploit digital data visualizations for their scholarly practices. Thus far, much of this work has been related to disciplinary studies. In this journal alone, for instance, in the last couple of years, we have been privy to Jeremy Tirrell’s digital maps that offer a geographical history of online rhetoric and composition journals as well as Derek Mueller’s nephological models of the CCCC Chairs’ Addresses. According to both these scholars, taking such risks to work with large data sets and to visually represent discrete information has many rewards. For Tirrell, “[g]eographical visualization is a potent means to examine our field's rich history,” and thanks to a wide range of apt and freely accessible tools and methods, this new mode of field research is not only possible but within our reach as motivated rhetoricians and compositionists. For Mueller, data visualizations such as tag clouds--or more accurately what Lev Manovich would call media visualizations since they build new representations out of the original media--help develop a networked sense, an aptitude that helps find patterns and themes in scholarly production and thus makes “keeping up” with the field’s work over the long haul less difficult.
</p><p>
In this webtext, I want to explore what data and media visualizations might do for visual rhetoric and circulation studies—the study of rhetoric and writing in motion. As a scholar who has spent the last six years tracking the circulation of Shepard Fairey’s now iconic Obama Hope image, I am intrigued by the idea of moving beyond studying visual artifacts as objects of study toward producing and deploying visual data to help document, analyze, and present research findings. Especially as scholars work with circulation to investigate how rhetoric is a process of distributed emergence and ongoing circulation (Edbauer Rice 2006), digital visualization has potential to help map out this complex process. As scholars grow more and more attuned to the networked complexity of visual rhetoric, they will thus benefit from finding ways to deal with large data sets and exploring how digital visualizations can enhance their scholarly practices. 
</p><p>
Current scholarship with cultural analytics is already making headway into the visualization of large collections of images and videos. The Software Studies Initiative under the lead of Lev Manovich, for instance, has produced a free software tool called ImagePlot that helps discover patterns in films, animations, video games, and other moving data. As Manovich explains, this software was produced in recognition of an ever-increasing professional and non-professional production of cultural content, which “over the last decade has created a fundamentally new cultural situation and a challenge to our normal ways of tracking and studying culture.” With such hyper-production of media, today scholars have opportunities to work with larger data sets than ever before. The question is: “how can we track "global digital cultures", with their billions of cultural objects, and hundreds of millions of contributors?”
</p><p>
In response to this research question, Manovich and team developed a set of methods and techniques called cultural analytics that helps to “describe images with images” (16). This method entails a.) processing digital images to automatically measure a number of visual characteristics or features of images within a collection set and b.) creating two dimensional visualizations that position images according to their feature values via the use of scatter plots, line graphs, and image plots, the latter of which superimposes images over data points on a graph (16-17). ImagePlot is a software specifically designed to perform both this computational analysis and media visualization. 
</p><p>
In general, information visualization is known to be useful when working with large data sets because it boosts several cognitive capabilities of the mind. As Collin Ware, author of Information Visualization: Perception for Design, has suggested, information visualization enables rapid interpretation of high quantities of information; enhances perception of trends, patterns, analogies, and threads; leads to new revelations about data and the way it is collected; facilitates understanding; and leads to hypothesis formation. And yet while cultural analytics and ImagePlot afford such cognitive abilities, they also offer visual rhetoricians specific benefits for comparing large data sets of images:
<ul>
<li>close the gap between close reading and distant reading so that both can be taken advantage of within one study</li>
<li>substantiate claims about a designer’s artistic style</li>
<li>make general statements about the style of certain genres</li>
<li>identify detailed patterns of change and evolution with a genre or artists’ oeuvre</li>
<li>notice subtle differences among images that the human eye cannot detect</li>
<li>reorganize images along different dimensions to produce opportunities for new questions and insights to emerge</li>
<li>simplify the method of content analysis or image annotation</li>
<li>represent variations in terms of color, pitch, grayscale, motion, size, etc. that human language cannot capture (4-13).</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
In light of such benefits, experimenting with ImagePlot would be useful to see what patterns and trends exist in relation to the style of a particular image such as the Obama Hope image (henceforth referred to as Obama Hope). In his article “The Annotated Obama Poster,” Ben McCorckle maps out various rhetorical observations about the design of Fairey’s Obama Hope poster, noting word choice, production techniques, patriotic color palette, historic propaganda poster design influences, and the appropriation of Mannie Garcia’s Obama Photo. The thousands of remixes of Obama Hope that have since been produced and have come to embody a cybergenre called Obamicons, which I discuss later, vary in color, portraiture, slogan, size, and production technique. Thus much could be learned about the style and genre of Obamicons from using a program such as ImagePlot to annotate these remixes and code for style differentiation. 
</p><p>
Yet while such visualizations could help discover important revelations about design, it does not help develop unique questions and insights in relation to a particular image’s circulation, distributed collective activities, and rhetorical transformation, which is my main concern here. Therefore, in this webtext, I explore how other kinds of interactive digital mapping such as Google Maps, Bubble Maps, Heat Maps, and Bar Graphs, which rely on an image’s metadata, can be productive for both doing and presenting research in visual rhetorics. I embarked upon this project in recognition that innovation, as Joyce Carter notes, is “a product of risk-taking with no guarantee of reward, and the very real possibility of failure.” Despite such risks, this innovative visual play with large data sets does illustrate that there is much to be gained by turning toward computational analysis and information visualization in visual rhetorical study.
