  			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  			<p>	
  			In this webtext, I have experimented with various visualizations to explore how visual rhetoric might benefit from putting digital visualization techniques to work. With little prior experience in digital visualizations and computational analysis, I am extremely grateful to Scott Weaver, who was able to listen and translate my data needs into visualizations that could not only advance my own research but also communicate findings to an audience. Such collaboration enabled us to produce visualizations that are much more sophisticated than I could ever have produced on my  own. Yet, perhaps even more importantly, such collaboration enabled me to gain confidence throughout the project to produce visualizations of my own. All together, then, this visual rhetoric project proves to be useful in the several ways. To conclude, I discuss three specific benefits with the hope that others visual rhetoricians will delve into their own data visualization projects to harness this research strategy’s immense potential.
</p><p>
    First digital visualization techniques are useful for extending data sets and helping researchers become more intimate with their objects of study. Such intimacy is, first of all, necessary for the design process. As Nathan Yau (2011) has argued, “you need to know your source material to tell good stories with data”; useful visualizations can only be designed if you “get to know your data and learn the context of the numbers” (p. 328). But in addition, becoming intimate with our objects of study can help deepen our research and ultimately our knowledge of an image’s rhetorical impact, especially when a runaway object’s story involves ongoing transnational circulation. While I had already spent six years tracking Obama Hope before embarking on this project, I discovered many previously unknown rhetorical experiences and genre activities during this research project. I was surprised to learn, for instance, just how many political and grassroots campaigns Obama Hope has participated in across the world. From fighting for gender equality in Singapore and Belgium to helping politicians in Spain win new votes to catalyzing support for both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Obama Hope’s rhetorical contributions simply just gets more intense with more in depth research. Setting the goal of coding 1000 pictures forced me to search for new data, new stories that could contribute to Obama Hope’s rhetorical biography. Digital visualization projects, then, are useful for deepening our data sets and complicating the rhetorical stories that we aim to tell.
</p><p>
    Second, digital visualization techniques can help generate quantifiable evidence to substantiate new claims and either confirm or revise past claims based on qualitative research. Too often scholars wait until after their research has been completed to use visualizations to present their research findings. While useful, such research limits the potential of digital visualization practices, which if implemented during the research process can help triangulate our data and support our own rhetorical claims. Such use of digital visualization techniques is essential when trying to account for phenomenon such as visual art movements. As I learned in generating the actor-network map (Figure 13), qualitative research does not always uncover the interconnectedness of actants embroiled in collective activities. Actor-network maps can expose such intra-actions and thus provide more accurate accounts of the phenomenon we wish to expose.
</p><p>
    Digital visualization techniques are especially essential when producing knowledge about novel cybergenres such as Obamicons. If we are going to make claims about the regularity and consistency of an emergent genre, we need to be able to quantify its widespread practice across time and space. But also, and especially, when we are trying to make claims about a single, multiple image’s transnational impact, we ought be able to verify our claims. While examples, interviews, and recorded documentation via Internet research can serve as persuasive evidence, geographic mapping that quantifies and visualizes a single, image’s widespread circulation, collective activity, and rhetorical transformation can help substantiate an image’s global impact. It can also, of course, point to new places for qualitative research, which often times leads to new insights and arguments. 
</p><p>
    Third, and lastly, digital visualization techniques can help boost our own data literacy. As many have noted, data literacy is becoming one of the most important critical skills to have in the 21st century. While we still don’t quite note what data literacy even entails, one vital skill of data literacy is data visualization. As visual rhetoricians, we certainly need to be able to read and interpret digital visualizations; as evident in any major news source being published today, data visualizations have become a mainstay in contemporary communication. Yet, especially in light of its ability to enhance our research process and communicate our research findings, it would also behoove us to figure out ways to design and produce visualizations not only for our own scholarly sake but for our students as well. This is especially the case as visual rhetoricians will not be excluded from the responsibility of “...making sense of content at new orders of magnitude,” (Losh, 2015, p. 286) a responsibility that comes with the ever increasing amount of pictorial data produced by an ever increasing amount of cultural producers.  Such undertaking with larger data sets and computational analysis might make us uncomfortable in our scholarly shoes, as it demands us developing new skills and taking new kinds of risks with our scholarship. But, testifying from my own experience with this project, when we take risks to be vulnerable with our scholarly production, our confidence increases, and we become more likely to experiment and innovate.
</p><p>
    I want to conclude by noting that as visual rhetoricians begin to increasingly find themselves in a digital humanities situation (Alvarado, 2011)--a situation in which we come to believe that digital technologies can play a crucial and transformative role in our interpretive process-- we ought not do so uncritically nor even quickly. As this webtext demonstrates, we can start out suspiciously, entering into a process of experimentation with hope for success yet also with openness toward failure. While we ought be working toward building teams that can collaborate on highly sophisticated digital visualizations techniques, we can also start out simply and slowly, playing with computational analysis and digital visualizations in ways that are productive yet still within our reach as scholars-on-the-way-to-becoming-data-literate. The most difficult trick is to figure out where we want to venture as visual rhetoric begins to adjust to the “new orders of magnitude” relating to visual and media production and just how we want to contribute to the humanities at large in the face of our contemporary data deluge. My hope is that this webtext will point toward productive ventures as we collaborate on large-scale digital research and visualization projects and learn together how to become more data literate.
