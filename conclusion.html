  			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  			
  			<p>		 
			  In some sense, information visualization can be considered a new phenomenon that is changing the way we think about the world and our relations to it. One only has to view TED conference presentations produced by the likes of ? and ? to literally see how information visualization both reflects and leads to some of the most innovative thinking out there today.
			</p><p> 
				Yet in his latest book, Thinking Like Einstein, Thomas West points out that infoviz is not a new phenomenon. It is simply, he argues, returning us to our “visual roots” with a new balance between the right and left hemispheres of our brain and their respective ways of thinking. Infoviz, he explains, is offering new opportunities for problem solving and big-picture thinking, but it is one of our oldest capabilities that has been utilized by visual thinkers across time and culture. West emphasizes, for instance, that “in Einstein’s efforts to explain the origin of his ideas, Einstein said that all of his most important and productive thinking was done by "combinatory play" with "images" in his mind. Only at a secondary stage did he "laboriously" translate these images into "conventional words" or the ‘signs of mathematics.’” Similarly, Gloria Anzaldua explains the importance of images in her way of knowing.  She writes, “An image is a bridge between evoked emotion and conscious knowledge; words are the cables that hold up the bridge.  Images are more direct, more immediate than words, and closer to the unconscious.  Picture language precedes thinking in words; the metaphorical mind precedes analytical consciousness” (90).  Anzaldua explains that her process of writing entails “picking out images from [her] soul’s eye, fishing forth the right words to recreate the images” (93).  Why is a reimaging of reality in our consciousness so important, she asks.  Because  “nothing happens in the ‘real’ world unless it first happens in the images in our heads” (109). 
			</p><p>
				It is obvious from both Einstein and Anzaldua’s testimonies that they conceive their ideas through play with images, yet what is also noticeable about these innovative thinkers is the role that visualization plays in their composing process. Not only can we think of Anzaldua and Einstein as visual thinkers, we can think of them as visual composers. As visual composers, I don’t mean that through the composing process they create visual arguments, which is usually what we mean by visual composing in our field.  Einstein and Anzaldua certainly do create visual arguments. But what I mean is that as visual composers, their composing process entails an act of serious play with the visuals in their mind.  To put it simply, for these visual thinkers composing is visual play. from this perspective, creating data visualizations is useful then not only because it helps boost the cognitive abilities as Ware notes, but also because it helps us engage in serious play with images so that we can compose new ideas on the page. Through data visualization, in other words, we can learn to compose in new, productive ways.
