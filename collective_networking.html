     		<h2>Mapping Collective Activity</h2>
<p>	     		
Obama Hope’s widespread genre uptake and rhetorical transformation has been made possible by a complicated network of collective activities distributed across time and space. This network is constituted by an entanglement of actors, perhaps best understood as actants, who are enmeshed in various associations in which they are “exchanging competencies, offering one another new possibilities, new goals, new functions” (Latour, 1999, p.182). This actor-network is not a fixed or static structure. Neither should it be understood as a series of fixed entities connected by relations signified by the lines that emerge when interacting with the map. Rather, as Levi Bryant, helped us understand, an actor network is constituted by interactions among various entities that are each doing something. “It is the actions,” Bryant explains, “that define the network, not a set of stable relationships or patterns that can be tracked throughout time despite changes in the entities enmeshed in the structure.” According to Latour, these actions, can be thought of as translations, in which the action of one actor sparks an action in an other. But Karen Barad (2007) reminded us with the notion of intra-action that when any two entities enter into relations, both are mutually transformed. Therefore, in new materialist terms, Figure 8 can best be understood as an attempt to map out the dynamic actor-network that is emerging as Obama Hope intra-acts with a multiplicity of actants throughout its ongoing rhetorical life.
</p><p>
The multiplicity of actants in any given collective activity is impossible to fully map out, but we can do activity theory research to gain a deeper sense of how a variety of heterogenous entities intra-act to accomplish specific rhetorical goals. Mapping is a useful research strategy to document and visualize such collective activity, especially as it enables us to identify the intra-actions among a constellation of involved actants. In regards to Obama Hope, Figure 8 ought be considered an early stage of such a mapping project in that it identifies the major activities in which Obama Hope has participated and the key actants in those activities. For the purposes of this mapping project, this list of actants, which are identified with a distinct color on the map’s key, includes digital technologies, organizations/institutions, events, genre artifacts, and, of course, people engaged in various collective activities.
</p><p>
This map began as a static map presented in the conclusion of Still Life with Rhetoric (see page 282). Since that publication, I have not only added many more actants and activities to this actor-network, I have also made the map interactive so that viewers can explore this network according to their own interests. Unlike the other maps in this webtext, this map is not directly linked to the metadata on my Google Spreadsheet and thus is not reliant on computational analysis. Nonetheless, I have included it here to help visualize just how distributed Obama Hope’s collective activity has thus far become and to supplement other visualizations in helping account for Obama Hope’s divergent genre activities and ongoing rhetorical transformation. (More data will be added to this actor-network as my research proceeds.)

To interact with this map, begin by clicking on the plus sign bottom center of the red button titled Obama Hope. From there, follow the links by continuing to find the plus signs at bottom center of the purple buttons, which identify the major collective activities in which Obama Hope has become involved. To learn more about Obama Hope’s unique encounters with each actant, click on the underlined text in each bubble, which functions as a url. You will be taken to a website where you can read more about Obama Hope’s collective activities.

  			<h2>OBSERVATIONS</h2> 
<p>
Liza Pott’s (2014) diagramming practices make evident that mapping out actor-networks can be a productive strategy for identifying the people, organizations, technologies, events, and so forth within a complex system. Potts advocated for creating such maps to not only examine how information surfaces and temporary connections within a particular system are formed but also for tracing the actors and associations within a particular network (p. 31). Such mapping, can, in turn, help build systems that are appropriate for managing activities and advocating for new policies and processes (p. 32). Yet for scholars, Potts argues, actor-network mapping can also help “pinpoint the people, organizations, technologies, places, and events that affect [a] network structure” and “visualize...ecosystems--the organic, engaging, and interactive networks” (p. 32). Such affordances of actor-network mapping are especially useful when trying to visualize the distributed activities of a run away object such as Obama Hope. Actor-network mapping can not only make visible the complexity of actants contributing to an image’s distributed activities, it can also make visible previously unrealized connections and intra-actions between those actants.
</p><p>
Part of the challenge in doing actor-network research is to give due credit to those nonhuman things that humans become entangled with to accomplish certain rhetorical goals. Mapping out the variety of technologies, organizations/institutions, and genres artifacts can help substantiate the importance of these entities in making collective action unfold. Figure 8, admittedly, does not do visual justice to the number of people who have intra-acted with Obama Hope--those people who both organized and participated in the identified events, those people who constitute the organizations/institutions, those people who designed, produced, and distributed the genre artifacts, and finally those people who invented and used various technologies that intensified Obama Hope’s production and accelerated its circulation. Such people deserve more representation on this actor-network map. But as scholars committed to new materialist studies of rhetoric, we also need to work hard to identify those nonhuman things that play such an important role in an image’s rhetorical transformation. Figure 8, for instance, demonstrates just how important not only Obamicons are in generating parody, participating in various campaigns and protests, launching satire, etc. but also the digital technologies that made possible the invention, production, and distribution of them. In addition, as previous research disclosed, Obama Hope’s distributed emergence and ongoing circulation would certainly not have been as intense without the help of social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, blogs, etc. Actor-network mapping can help substantiate such claims as it is able to make visible just how imbricated such things are in the collective activities of a runaway object.
</p><p>
Actor networking mapping also and especially useful for discovering new connections and intra-actions between various actants that qualitative research might not uncover. Figure 13, for instance, makes visible many of the interconnected activities in which Obama Hope participated during the 2008 presidential election. As I discussed elsewhere (2015), the exact connections between various activities between Yosi Sergant, Shepard Fairey, and Obama’s official campaign have yet to be fully disclosed. At issue is whether Fairey and Sargent helped orchestrate a top down visual propaganda campaign to win votes for Obama or if an Obama art movement emerged as a bottoms up, grassroots phenomenon, disconnected from Sergant, Fairey, and presumably the official campaign. Figure 8 affirms that more research ought be done into this issue as this map makes visible connections that were not otherwise visible. For instance, early on in 2008, the Obama Street Art group emerged on Flickr to document the proliferation of Obama Hope (as well as other Obama art) and to stimulate dialogue about Obama. In order to find the url for David Combs, the originator of this group, I visited Comb’s magazine’s website where I noticed Shepard Fairey/Obey Giant was not only listed as the magazine’s friend but also as a commonly featured artist. Could Fairey, on his own accord or upon advice from Sergant (the public relations guru intent on making Fairey’s Hope poster going viral during the election season and who had earlier ties to Obama’s campaign) asked Combs to develop that Flickr site to draw more attention to Obama Hope and thus more support for Obama? Figure 13 certainly shows that Combs has close ties to Fairey and thus points toward the need for more research into their exact connections in order to paint a clearer vision of how this movement emerged. Visualizations such as actor network maps thus prove useful for pointing to new relations that, in turn, foster deeper research.
</p><p>
In light of such benefits, scholars interested in studying the circulation, transformation, and consequentiality of visual rhetoric might invest more time and energy into making actor-network mapping a more integral part of their research process. While I discovered Pott’s scholarship after creating and describing my collective activity map above, Potts (2014) has written extensively about actor-network mapping as a research method, going so far as to describe this method in such detail that it can be easily adapted for other projects. Potts’ mapping strategies of using noun icons and signifying relationships with thickness of lines seem especially useful in helping to make new discoveries about our objects of study. As we press on in developing digital visualization techniques for studies of visual rhetoric, then, we ought thus adopt and build on Pott’s method. Adding a chronological dimension to actor-network maps would prove especially useful in visualizing the distributed emergence of which Edbauer’s rhetorical ecology model speaks.
