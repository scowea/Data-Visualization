  			<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>
For my visualizations, I was interested in showing several things about Obama Hope:<br>
<ul>
<li>the places in which it has traveled
<li>the genres in which it has emerged  
<li>the media in which it has surfaced
<li>the collective activities in which it has become embroiled
<li>the rhetorical functions it has taken on via such collective activity
</ul> 
</p><p>
I thus created a Fushion Table with multiple columns that enabled me to not only record the url of the image and the url of the social media or website documenting Obama Hope’s circulation, transformation, and collective activity but also to generate metadata in several categories: 
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>1. Location:</h4> 
<p>Where has Obama Hope circulated within and beyond the U.S. border?
<br>
--Metadata entered here is intended to identify the geographical spot in which a reproduction or remix of Obama Hope was created and/or photographed. 
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>2. Date:</h4> 
<p>When has Obama Hope surfaced in different manifestations and engaged in various collective activities? 
<br>
--Metadata here is intended to identify the dates in which Obama Hope manifested in a particular artifact. In many cases, the exact date in which Obama Hope surfaces is unclear. However, thanks to the date features of Flickr, blogs, online news sources, and editorial photographic services, I have been able to provide an approximate date in which Obama Hope surfaced in a particular artifact or location. 
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>3. Media:</h4> 
<p>While media often refers to a communication channel such as the Interent or radio, in this case, media takes on more of an artistic definition in that it refers to either the material in which the Obama Hope image<sup>3</sup> has been constructed. The media in which Obama Hope has been constructed has been particularly diverse. In some cases, for instance, Obama Hope has surfaced on the cloth of tshirts while in other cases, Obama Hope surfaced in paint on an urban street wall or in a portrait made out of jellybeans. To demonstrate the variety of materials with which Obama Hope has entered into relations, in this media category, I thus identify the material out of which Obama Hope reproductions and remixes was crafted (ie, ink, icing, paper, paint, thread, etc.). In the case of digital images, some were created out of geometrical primitives such as lines via vector processes while others were created out of pixels via raster processes. In most cases, I was unable to decipher which processes were used to create the digital images. Therefore, I identified the media of all such artifacts as digital image files. 
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>4. Art Form:</h4> 
<p>
What kind of form as Obama Hope surfaced on/in?
<br>
--Metadata here identifies the various forms in which Obama Hope has materialized. The range of forms has been diverse to say the least. Obama Hope as surfaced in pancakes, murals, stickers, menus, posters, belt buckles, earrings, and even tattoos.
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>5. Genre:</h4> 
<p>What kind of genres has Obama Hope become engaged in as the artifacts in which it surfaced took on various social actions?
<br>
--Metadata entered here is informed by my own identification of a genre or the identification made by an artist, craft person, journalist who created or wrote about a particular artifact.  In this data visualization project, identifying the genre of each artifact that reproduces or remixes Obama Hope has proved difficult, as many of the artifacts fall under the broad genre category of visual art—the distinct types of which are defined differently by various actors and thus often blur depending on their classification. In line with Carolyn Miller’s (1984) argument that genre ought be thought of as “typified rhetorical actions based in recurrent situations” (159), I thus generated my own definitions for the genres based on the specific use in which the artifacts are deployed in the collective actions in which I discovered them. As such, while Obama Hope (in its Faireyized version) may have first appeared in a grassroots campaign poster to generate support for Obama, it often transformed across genre and function to appear in protest signs, political posters unrelated to Obama, advertisements, etc. Except for its appearance in Fairey’s original posters, the genre identified in the Google Fushion sheet is always coded for Obama Hope’s secondary purpose evident in the picture that captures its then-present manifestation.
</p><p>
In addition, for data visualization purposes, I have grouped artifacts that relate to each other in function but not necessarily in form and media under one genre heading. For instance, under Art for Design, I have designated advertising signs as well as graphic designs created for mass produced utilitarian products. Under Art for Commemoration, I have designated artifacts specifically produced for the Obama/Biden Inaugural Committee such as Fairey’s “Be the Change” poster as well as reproductions of Obama Hope that have been produced during Black History month to commemorate Obama’s historical achievement. Such coding approach is limited in that it tends to belie the nuanced rhetorical actions of a particular artifact. However, this coding approach is useful for avoiding visualizations that are overcrowded with metadata categories and hence difficult to comprehend. 
</p><p>
Each artifact has been assigned one genre category, except when an artifact originated as an Obamicon. For instance, as articulated below Obamicons, which depend on parody and satire, are often printed out and turned into rally /protest signs for activist purposes or created as fan art. In such cases, those particular artifacts are categorized as both Obamicon and rally/protest sign or fan art. (See Rally/Protest Sign and fan art categories below). I conducted this double coding so I could keep track of how many Obamicons have been produced and in use since 2008.  
</p><p>
For clarification purposes, I define the genre’s listed on the Google Fushion table below. 
</p><p>
<b>ART/CRAFT FOR OBAMA:</b> Non-utilitarian and utilitarian artifacts that reproduce or remix Obama Hope in order to garner support for Obama’s presidential elections. Much of this art contributed to the Obama Art movement, a grassroots art campaign that emerged in 2008 to help Obama become the 44th president of the United States. Such art has been featured on blogs specifically designed to record this unique moment in art and presidential history such as the Obama Art Report and The Art of Obama. In terms of craft, many of these utilitarian items were highlighted on Flickr Pages such as Crafters for Obama, a place for “artsy craftsy folks to showcase items made to show their “support of Barack Obama's presidential campaign.” On this page, one can find objects ranging from crosstitched purses to bottle caps to homemade signs to knitted sweaters, all reproducing and/or remixing Obama Hope.
</p><p>
<b>COMMEMORATIVE ART:</b> Artifacts that reproduce or remix Obama Hope in order to commemorate Obama’s presidential victory and pay homage to the first African American man voted into the presidential seat. Many of these artifacts relate specifically to Obama’s inauguration. For instance, artifacts ranging from banners hung from light posts in Chicago to Fairey’s Be the Change poster to Firefly media’s video projection of Fairey’s Hope poster in Hollywood were put on public display during Obama’s inauguration in January of 2009. Other artifacts such as Obama Hope cupcakes were produced for small celebrations as people gathered to watch the televised inaugural event. Yet, since 2009, much of this commemorative art surfaced in the form of murals and paintings in schools and community centers to celebrate Black History Month and inspire young students. Perhaps most interesting are the numerous tattoos that people adorned their bodies with to pay homage to Obama. In addition, many people across the world create and display posters with Obama Hope when Obama is visiting their country. These artifacts have been designated in this category as they were not used to support Obama’s victory but rather to show respect for him as president.
</p><p>
<b>OBAMABILIA:</b> Collectibles with reproductions or remixes of Obama Hope that are intended to memorialize Obama’s presidential victory and be kept because of their historical link to Obama’s presidential victory. As New York Times blogger Katharine Seelye (2008) has stated in her post “Obamabilia for Sale,” “Selling Barack Obama memorabilia has been lucrative for everyone from souvenir dealers to newspaper publishers to the Franklin Mint [to the Obama inaugural team].” Obama Hope surfaced on a diverse range of memorabilia ranging from medallions to flags to buttons to totes to pins to coffee mugs to clocks to watches to t-shirts. Many of these items are still available on eBay and other websites specifically devoted to Obama memorabilia. 
</p><p>
<b>POLITICAL ART:</b> Art that reproduces or remixes Obama Hope in a variety of forms, media, and styles to intentionally communicate a political message, show approval of or disdain for a political figure, or make commentary about a particular political. Much of this political art has been created by amateur and professional artists and graphic designers to voice their opinions on a wide range of political issues, ranging from political propaganda to drones to the NSA. Much of this political art was produced in digital form, published on various online outlets, and experienced broad circulation via the Internet. Yet much political art in the form of murals, stencils, yarn bombs, stickers, and wheatpastes were displayed in urban spaces and intended for mass audiences<sup>4</sup>. While many murals were placed on urban walls to promote Obama’s messages (and thus categorized as Art for Obama), for instance, many other political murals with Obama Hope surfaced to commented on socialist propaganda, American politics, and the BP oil spill (See Figure). Obama Hope has also surfaced in the political art of artists such as Matt Sesow who have sold their work on professional websites. 
</p><p>
<b>OBAMICON:</b> Digitally born posters produced in the Obama Hope style and layout via an array of digital technologies that function as parody and satire. Many Obamicons are raster and vector graphics and never materialize beyond their digital form, yet they circulate via the Internet and appear in blog posts, online news articles, online archives, political and educational websites, etc. where they interact with text to enact a diverse range of functions. In many of these capacities Obamicons function as playful parodies as they pay homage to certain celebrities, movie or televisions shows, and even sport figures and teams. Many Obamicons also clearly function for personal enjoyment, as people upload pictures of themselves and insert silly captions obviously to entertain. Obamicons also, however, often act satirically as they criticize various politicians and articulate dissent from official government authorities and their political practices. U.S. political figures were especially popular targets in 2008, but since then foreign figures such as David Cameron, Vladimir Putin, and Muammar Gaddafi have also received their fair share of attention. While Obamicons are digitally born, many are printed on t-shirts, hats, and other attire and sold on ecommerce stores such as Zazzle, CafePress, and the People’s Cube. More importantly, perhaps, Obamicons have also been printed out and used in protests, campaigns, and image events in which they have proven potential to stir public debate. As I argue elsewhere (2013), Obamicons ought thus be considered to be an important new cybergenre inspired by Obama Hope. 
</p><p>
<b>IRANICON:</b> Digitally born posters produced in the Obama Hope style yet in the color palette of Iran’s flag to help support the Iranian Green Movement in 2009. Unlike Obamicons which were produced before Pastemagazine developed the Obamicon.me website, Iranicons were an original invention produced by Pastemagazine. 
</p><p>
<b>PROTEST ART:</b> Artifact with reproduction or remix of Obama Hope that is displayed in a public rally, demonstration, or image event to assist collective efforts to protest against a political figure, challenge the status quo, raise public awareness, and/or galvanize change in policies or practices that affect a large population. Artifacts in this category may also be produced or appropriated by individual activists taking part in political demonstrations or may be officially involved with a specific campaign or social movement (other than those related to Obama’s election). While Obama Hope has been remixed by individuals protesting the NSA, for instance, it has also worked in Germany to help Greenpeace fight for environmental justice; in Sydney to help the Australian Hemp Party achieve victory in the 2013 National Election Campaign; and in Mexico to assist the #Not1More campaign in fighting against U.S. deportation policies and practices. 
</p><p>
<b>COMMERCIAL ART:</b> Graphic designs that reproduce or remix Obama Hope in order to increase sales of a mass produced product or service, announce content (as in a book cover), or advertise a particular event. These designs are typically created for a particular client or organization with a specific advertising or selling goal in mind. In terms of commercial art, Obama Hope has surfaced on a wide variety of mass-produced, utilitarian items such as cell phone covers, mousepads, computer sleeves, keys, business card holders, and skateboards. In a wide variety of signs, Obama Hope has also surfaced to advertise everything from coffee to haircuts to bake sales to music events. Obama Hope has been especially popular for the outer covers of magazines ranging from Esquire to Harper’s Magazine to Mad Magazine to The Advocate. And while much of its production has been targeted toward a U.S. audience, it has also surfaced in places as disparate as Istanbul and Kenya to sell, among other things, banking services, biscuits, and clothing. 
</p><p>
<b>CHARITY ART:</b> Artifacts with reproductions or remixes of Obama Hope that are produced to raise funds for local causes or non-profit organizations. While Obama Hope has surfaced to raise funds for Obama and hence been categorized as Art for Obama, Obama Hope has also been produced in a wide range of materials to raise funds for non-profit organizations, local schools, and youth organizations. In 2009, for example, Obama Hope was created in a large canstruction to raise money for a local food bank in Portland, Oregon.
</p><p>
<b>ART FOR CREATIVE EXPRESSION:</b>  Limited production artifacts made by hand or computer that reproduce or remix Obama Hope for aesthetic purposes or creative expression rather than communicating a specific political message. Handmade art in this genre category have been crafted out of wide variety of materials such as wood, metal, food (ie. baklava, beans, icing, pancakes, chocolate,) and recycled materials (ie. dryer lint, license plates, credit cards, soda cans). Computer generated artifacts have been generated via pixels from sources such as Minecraft blocks and vectors in the WPAP style. Many artifacts in this category are not for sale; they have been made for individual fulfillment and artistic challenge and posted on personal blogs or Flickr. For instance, Mariann Asanuma (2009), creator of a Lego mosaic of Obama Hope, testifies on her blog that she did not create her Lego portrait for political reasons. She was simply inspired by Fairey’s image and wanted to see if she could reproduce it out of Legos. In other cases, artists have chosen to sell their creative designs. Etsy and Deviant Art members, for instance, have reproduced Obama Hope alongside other popular figures such as John Lennon and Marilyn Monroe in a similar style and media, indicating that their Obama Hope rendition was primarily produced for aesthetic purposes in limited production pieces. 
</p><p>
<b>PROP:</b> Artifact with reproduction or remix of Obama Hope that is used as assistance for educational, theatrical, or comedic purposes. As evident in its multiple appearances on The Colbert Report and The Daily Show with John Stewart, plays such as Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, and movies such as IronMan 2, Obama Hope has become a useful prop for entertaining audiences. However, Obama Hope has also taken on educational significance, as it has appeared in slide presentations to educate audiences about remix, anti-Obama rhetoric, memes, visual rhetoric, and copyright infringement.
</p><p>
<b>POLITICAL CARTOON:</b> Illustration in which reproductions or remixes of Obama Hope appear to help make commentary relating to current events or contemporary figures. As Edwards and Winkler (2005) have argued, political cartoons often rely on visual ideographs<sup>5</sup> to assist political cartoons in using satire, parody, and irony to spark people’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. To do so, of course, an image that functions as a visual ideograph needs to be easily recognizable to a relevant community, even as it can exist in multiple forms in different cartoons. As such, as Edwards and Winkler note, only a few images in U.S. culture such as the Iwo Jima image, the American Gothic painting, and the “I Want You” poster of Uncle Sam can function as visual ideographs. To this list, we can add Obama Hope; for by the time Obama began his first term, it had become so widely highly visible that it could easily function as a visual ideograph in many political cartoons to satirize Obama’s administration and U.S. American’s responding sentiment. Since then, Obama Hope has surfaced in a wide range of political cartoons to make political commentary about a number of contemporary political issues such as the 2013 IRS scandal and the infamous NSA surveillance leaks.  
</p><p>
<b>FAN ART:</b> Art that reproduces or remixes Obama Hope to pay homage to a particular fictional character or show, celebrities, political icons, athletes, or athletic teams. Many Obamicons have been produced to function as fan art as especially evident on Deviant Art where digital posters paying homage to James Bond, Twilight, and Anthony Bordain, among a plethora of others. Yet, Obama Hope has also surfaced at athletic events to show support for certain teams or players.  	 
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>6. Rhetorical Function:</h4> 
<p>
<b>PARODY:</b> Artifact that imitates the style of Fairey’s Obama Hope poster for the purposes of comedy or entertainment. The new content may remix Obama Hope or it may focus on a new figure or event altogether. 
</p><p>
<b>SATIRE:</b> Artifact that reproduces or remixes Obama Hope to ridicule a particular person, practice, or event and evoke attitudes of amusement, scorn, contempt, or indignation.

	<sup>3</sup> As W.J.T. Mitchell has made clear, an image is that which surfaces in a pictorial object (picture, photograph, painting, sculpture, etc.). An image can transcend media.<br>
	<sup>4</sup> I have chosen not to categorize such art as street art because it is not always clear whether such placement of art was sanctioned or not.<br>
	<sup>5</sup> According to Edwards and Winkler, visual ideographs have four characteristics. First, they are ordinary images that are found in political discourse aimed to influence the beliefs and actions of both the political elite and their non-elite constituents (126). Second, visual ideographs are high-ordered abstractions that represent collective commitments to particular yet ambiguous and ill-defined goals (128). As such, multiple interpretations of an image can be surmised. Third, visual ideographs warrant certain uses of power; excuse certain beliefs and/or actions that might be deemed eccentric or antisocial; and guide behavior and beliefs deemed acceptable and laudable by a relevant communities (128). Fourth, visual ideographs are, and must be, culture-bound (131).
