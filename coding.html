  			<h2>Coding and Interpretation</h2>
<p>
To store, organize, and analyze my research data, I initially relied on Zotero, which helped me mine data and save urls that documented Obama Hope’s multiple transformations and collective activities as well as organize them in folders to help identify their rhetorical functions (See Gries 2013; 2015). To organize and analyze data for this project, I relied on data found during my prior research, but I also conducted another extensive round of iconographic tracking to create a boutique data set -- smaller data sets, based on quantitative and qualitative research, that have proven useful to individual scholar’s own research projects but currently are inaccessible to other researchers (Ball, Graban, & Sidler 5). I also needed a tool that would allow me to easily categorize, manipulate and export this dataset for specific and custom digital visualizations. I thus entered my research findings into a Google Spreadsheet in order to leverage Google Fusion Tables--an open source app that enables researchers, without an IT background, to easily upload, organize, query, and share data sets (See Figure 1). With Google Fushion Data, different APIs can programmatically be queried, and the results can be data mined at realtime to create more advanced and custom visualizations. This provides the advantage that most maps, charts, and graphs contained within my collection immediately reflect any changes and additions to the dataset.
</p>

<p>
For this project, I was particularly interested in visualizing data about Obama Hope’s circulation,  genre uptake, and collective activities. I thus created a Fushion Table with multiple columns that enabled me to not only record the url of the image and the url of the social media or website documenting Obama Hope’s manifestations but also to generate metadata in the categories explicated below. 	
</p>

<h4>1. Location:</h4> 
<p>Where has Obama Hope circulated within and beyond the U.S. border?
<br>
--Metadata identifies the geographical spot in which a reproduction or remix of Obama Hope was created and/or photographed. Location data was mainly collected via tags on Flickr, editorial photograph captions and use information, author bios on blogs, Deviant art pages, Behance, and other social media sites. 
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>2. Date:</h4> 
<p>When has Obama Hope surfaced in different manifestations and engaged in various collective activities? 
<br>
--Metadata here identifies the dates in which Obama Hope manifested in a particular artifact. In many cases, the exact date in which Obama Hope surfaces is unclear. However, thanks to the date features of Flickr, blogs, online news sources, and editorial photographic services, I have been able to provide an approximate date in which Obama Hope surfaced in a particular artifact or location. 
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>3. Media:</h4> 
<p>In what media has Obama Hope surfaced? 
<br>
--Metadata here identifies the material in which the Obama Hope image has been constructed. Such media has been quite diverse. In some cases, for instance, Obama Hope has surfaced on the cloth of t-shirts while in other cases, Obama Hope has surfaced in paint on an urban street wall or in a portrait made out of jellybeans. To demonstrate the variety of materials in which Obama Hope has surfaced, this media category identifes the material out of which Obama Hope reproductions and remixes was crafted (ie, ink, icing, paper, paint, vinyl, thread, etc.). In the case of digital images, some were created out of geometrical primitives such as lines via vector processes while others were created out of pixels via raster processes. In most cases, I was unable to decipher which processes were used to create the digital images. Therefore, I identified the media of all such artifacts as digital image files.
<br><br>
</p>


<h4>4. Art Form:</h4> 
<p>
What kind of art form as Obama Hope surfaced on/in?
<br>
--Metadata here identifies the various art forms in which Obama Hope has appeared. The range of forms has been diverse to say the least. Obama Hope as surfaced in food art, murals, menus, posters (digital and print), belt buckles, mousepads, mosaics, and even tattoos. In cases where multiple art forms relate, they have been coded under one umbrella term. Visualizations such as pie charts become especially difficult to read and interpret when multiple categories exist, especially when few items are listed under each category. Therefore, rather than list individual clothing items (shoe, t-shirt, hat, sweatshirt, etc.) and accessories (tie, beltbuckle, jewelry, phone covers, business card holders, etc.) separately, these art forms fall under the single categories of attire and accessory, respectively.
<br><br>
</p>

<h4>5. Rhetorical Function:</h4> 
<p>
What specific rhetorical function has Obama Hope taken on as it has surfaced in/on a particular artifact?
<br>
--Metadata here identifies the primary rhetorical function of the artifact bearing Obama Hope as it was discovered during iconographic tracking. For data validation purposes, I only assigned one function to each artifact based on designer’s testimony of intent; depicted collective activity; placement and content of artifact, etc. While such coding belies the plurality of functions that many artifacts serve in any given situation, identifying the primary function of an artifact based on empirical evidence at hand discourages unnecessary interpretation of function on my part and thus helps to validate data.
<br><br>
</p>

<h4>6. Genre:</h4> 
<p>
What kind of genre has Obama Hope become engaged in as the artifacts in which it surfaced taken on various social actions? (For a list of genre definitions, please click here.)
<br>
--Metadata entered here is informed by my own identification of a genre or the identification made by an artist, craft person, journalist who created or wrote about a particular artifact.  Genres are based on the specific use in which the artifacts are deployed in the collective actions in which I discovered them. As such, while Obama Hope (in its Faireyized version) may have first surfaced as election art to generate support for Obama, it often transformed across genre and function to appear in protest signs, political posters unrelated to Obama, advertisements, etc. Except for its appearance in Fairey’s original posters, the genre identified in the Google Fushion sheet is always coded for Obama Hope’s secondary purpose evident in the picture that captures its then-present manifestation. 


<br><br>
</p>

<p>
In addition, for data visualization purposes, I have grouped artifacts that relate to each other in function but not necessarily in form and media under one genre heading. For instance, under Commericial Art, I have designated advertising signs as well as graphic designs created for mass produced utilitarian products. Under Commemorative Art, I have designated artifacts specifically produced for the Obama/Biden Inaugural Committee such as Fairey’s “Be the Change” poster as well as reproductions of Obama Hope that have been produced during Black History month to commemorate Obama’s historical achievement. Such coding approach is limited in that it tends to belie the nuanced rhetorical/social actions of a particular artifact. However, as discussed above, this coding approach is useful for avoiding visualizations that are overcrowded with metadata categories and hence difficult to communicate and comprehend.
</p><p>
For data validation purposes, each artifact has been assigned one genre category, except artifacts whose Obama Hope design originated as an Obamicon (digitally born posters produced in the Obama Hope style and layout via an array of digital technologies) yet took on secondary functions when printed out and transformed in use. For instance, Obamicons, which depend on parody and often satire, are often turned into protest signs in which they show up on urban streets for activist purposes. In such cases, those particular artifacts are categorized as both Obamicon and rally/protest sign. I conducted this double coding so I could keep track of how many Obamicons are included in the data set.
</p><p>
On this latter note, the data set includes ~320 Obamicons. This is just a small sample of the thousands of Obamicons that have been created since 2008. While this data set could be expanded in the future by documenting more Obamicons, I chose to only include a representative sample in order to give adequate attention in the data set to the multiple genres and unique artifacts in which Obama Hope has materialized. To discover the most common figures depicted and captions used in Obamicons, please see the Obamicon Page.

<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>

<p>
Because this digital visualization project is a very much an experiment, I have included a limited set of interpretations at the bottom of each page of maps. These interpretations ought to be thought of more as observations, as I simply describe what I noticed from each map about Obama Hope and discuss how such observations furthered my research process or might benefit visual rhetoric research in the future. In this sense, the visualizations presented in this webtext ought be considered research-oriented in that while I designed them to represent and communicate various information about Obama Hope, they are first and foremost a research tool. As we begin to explore what computer generated visualizations can do for visual rhetoric, we need to make the use value of such visualizations explicit so that others can learn from our digital research strategies. As a field, we can learn together how to make best use of digital visualization techniques to assist us in our shared inquiries.
</p><p>
Such co-learning is an opportunity that digital visualizations and online journals such as Kairos especially make possible. One mantra that has become foundational to the digital humanities is that the tools and visualizations we build must be interactive. As Stéfan Sinclair, Stan Ruecker, and Milena Radzikowska (2013) have made clear, while static visualizations such as pie charts aim to produce a single perspective on the presented data, interactive visualizations aim to explore data, often as part of a process that is both sequential and iterative. “That is, some steps come before others, but the researcher may revisit previous steps at a later stage and make different choices, informed by the outcomes produced in the interim” (par. 2). The spatio temporal maps designed to study circulation, as I discuss in the following section, are especially interactive in that the maps evolved as I studied them, made specific observations, collected and presented more data, and updated visualizations over a two year period. Such interactivity is especially useful to help generate a more complete data set and discover new patterns and research paths. However, this process ought not just involve the researchers. If we make maps available to our colleagues during our research process, they too can be involved in both the production of our visualizations and the conclusions we draw from our research. Collective intelligence, if we are to take it seriously, ought extend to our research process in circles wide beyond our small scholarly networks or collaborative teams.
</p><p>
To foster such kind of interactive, collaborative research process, I have made it possible for visitors to upload their own observations and questions in the comment bars alongside the text and visualizations. In this way, the interpretation process becomes a collective knowledge-producing activity. Too often, scholars are left alone with their data, pressured to draw conclusions about data they are often too intimate with to see objectively. In addition, for rhetoric scholars, data literacy is typically not prioritized in our graduate education or ongoing professionalization. Data literacy entails the ability to gather, evaluate, visualize, draw conclusions from, and communicate data to generate new knowledge. For some, data literacy might be a natural aptitude, but for me and many others, the ability not only to analyze big and boutique data but also visualize and communicate data does not come easy. Therefore, the interactive interpretative process in this digital visualization project is intended to provide an opportunity not only to produce knowledge together but also to learn together. I hope you will both interact with the various visualizations and participate in the subsequent observation sections.
